# fancy-slider-resolving

1. resolved the image loading issue (typo in second .then of hits , was hitS in getImages function
2. added enter key functionality while in the search box
3. resolved the slider loading issue (another typo in the index.html file because in the app.js there were 3 meaningful names spelled duration but in the html it was spelled doration . So changing the html or 1 change looked okay and also the meaning of the id was kept)
4. error checked the duration time
5. added enter button functionality in the duration input box
6. resetting the duration input box value when one slider is made
7. added alert for the user whether there is net connection or not OR data is not getting for any reasons from the server
